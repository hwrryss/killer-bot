# Killer-bot

A simple telegram bot i made as a hackathon task to play "The Killer" game, rules of which (i found them only in russian) https://mipt.ru/about/general/anniversary/61/Game_Killers/ you can check out here. The actual bot just modifies the game with QR-codes instead of paper pieces


## To run:
  - Create a bot and get a token from @BotFather, insert it in the bot code.
  - Clone this repository
  - Run ``` docker build . ```
  - ``` docker images ``` to get the ID of the current container
  - ``` docker run {container id} ```

Enjoy :)
