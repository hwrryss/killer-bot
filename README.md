## Killer-bot

# A simple telegram bot i made as a hackathon task to play "The Killer" game, rules of which (i found them only in russian) https://mipt.ru/about/general/anniversary/61/Game_Killers/ you can check out here. The actual bot just modifies the game with QR-codes instead of paper pieces


## To run:
  - create a bot and get a token from @BotFather
  - git clone this repository
  - go to the directory with the clone
  - run ''' docker build . '''
  - ''' docker images ''' and get the ID of the current container
  - ''' docker run {container id} '''

Enjoy :)
